# Why this game? í´”

I decided to take the challenge on completing level 1 to 20 because it got to a point where i was just watching videos about Linux and decided i wanted hands of learning.
I found this game and ever since i found it i have learnt so much and understood Linux even more.
I highly recommend anyone learning Linux to take on the challenge from level's 1-20 to see how you get on!
