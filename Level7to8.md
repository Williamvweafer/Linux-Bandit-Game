# Level 7 > 8

Goal: 
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

## What I Did:

- I first ran the command ls to confirm i can see data.txt
- I then used the command cat data.txt but i knew it would not be that easy! it was a large file with many words
- So to find the password, in the goal it says the password is next to the world millionth i ran the command cat data.txt | greg millionth
- Running that command filtered the file and i found the password

Password Found: dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

## What Did I Learn?

I learned in this level that when dealing with big files, itâ€™s way easier to use grep to search for specific words instead of reading through everything manually. In this case, just running grep millionth data.txt gave me exactly what I needed.
